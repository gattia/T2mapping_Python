# T2mapping_Python

This program is being transformed from a Matlab script that I used to create T2maps of knee MRI data. Ultimately, the goal is to turn this into a progam that can either run independently, or to turn it into a module for 3DSlicer.

Currently (September 30th) the program imports all of the dicom images from a folder in order and then turns them into a 4D matrcix where dimension 1 = y; 2 = x; 3 = slice; 4 = time (echo). This 4D matrix allows for relatively easy manipulation and location of specific image data (slices & echos in particular). Next a figure pops up to allow the user to select an ROI, then the ROI is extracted from the image, and transverse relaxation time (T2) is calcualted for each pixel of the first 3 dimensions. The calculated T2 is placed in a new matrix, at the same location that T2 was calculated from. This creates a T2map of the ROI. We then need to put the T2map of the ROI back into a matrix the same size as the original data, this is to allow for further process because the dicom header info is specific to a matrix of the original dimensions. So, the T2map of the ROI is put into a matrix that is the same size as the first 3-dimensions of the original 4D data and into the same location as it was taken out of. This T2map will then be exported and can be analyzed elsewhere. Currently the data is not yet exported, that will be the next step in the process.
